	DESCRIPTION:
		This function will check if the given ASL position is contaminated
		
	PARAMETERS:
		Position ASL
			The position to check
			
	RETURNS
		Array
			Type 1
				Bool showing the area is contaminated with a type 1 chemical
			Type 2
				Bool showing the area is contaminated with a type 2 chemical
			Type 3
				Bool showing the area is contaminated with a type 3 chemical
		
	EXAMPLE
		(getPosASL player) call CBRN_fnc_isAreaContaminated
